  <h1>Nullfin</h1>
  <p>A small, practical bridge between Stremio add-ons and Jellyfin clients.</p>
</div>

Nullfin takes the Stremio add-ons you already use and makes their streams available through a Jellyfin-compatible server. Connect your add-ons, point your preferred client at Nullfin, and you are ready to browse.

I made this fork after running into the same rough edges over and over: incomplete source lists, slow pickers, and migrations that could stall on one unavailable add-on. The fixes live here so the setup is simpler for everyone who comes next.

## What is different

- Compatible clients get the complete source list instead of one `Remote - Unknown` entry.
- The source picker opens without waiting for every remote file to be probed first.
- File sizes can come straight from the add-on when they are available.
- Add-on scores can appear directly in the source list.
- Selecting a source still uses the normal playback checks, so the faster list does not skip the important part.
- The fixes work with standard Stremio streaming add-ons, not just one specific service.

Regular Jellyfin playback behavior stays intact. The faster source-list path is used only for clients that need that compatibility handling.

## Run it

```yaml
services:
  nullfin:
    image: ghcr.io/nullstreamin/nullfin:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, create the admin account, and add your Stremio manifest URLs from the Addons page. Then add Nullfin to your media client as a Jellyfin server.

That is enough for most setups. If an add-on cannot be reached during an import, Nullfin keeps it disabled so the rest of the migration can finish. You can fix or remove that entry afterward.

## A couple of sensible notes

Keep the data folder persistent and back it up before updating. Pin `ghcr.io/nullstreamin/nullfin:v0.31.1` instead of `latest` if you would rather update manually.

Manifest URLs can contain API keys or personal tokens, so do not paste configured URLs into screenshots, bug reports, or public Compose files.

## Updates

The plan is to keep Nullfin close to the project it came from and bring over useful changes without turning maintenance into a second job. New builds will be tested before the `latest` tag moves.
